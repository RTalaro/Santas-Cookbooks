Ho...
Hello, young lad...
...
Why so down, you ask?
Well, you see... there's been some trouble as of late.
Some elves sought to play, and led my deer astray.
We crashed our sleigh and all of my cookbooks flew away...
Now the table remains empty and Mrs. Claus lies in wait.
...
...
Really? Do you think you could do that?
Would you truly help this old man over ninety?
How wonderful! How jolly!
I'll head back out and repair the sleigh. Once you're done, return back to me!
Hohoho!
Hoho hohohoooo!
